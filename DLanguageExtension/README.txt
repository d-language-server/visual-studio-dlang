Getting started

This extension uses the Language Server Protocol (https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).
As such, Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8 is the minimum supported version.
Besides this, you should have a D compiler installed, as well as Dub.

To use this extension, simply open a folder in Visual Studio and then open a D file.
The language server will be started up automatically by Visual Studio.
